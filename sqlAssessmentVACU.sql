/*
Question 1
=======================================================
Provide a list of the following field names for all customers 
that have purchased productname “widget”: 
    - contactname
    - address (customers table)
    - city (customers table)
    - postalcode (customers table)

Question 2
=======================================================
Place the above list into a temp table.

-- This looked like the easiest way, but it felt TOO easy

Question 3
=======================================================
Pull the list from question 1 from the temp table removing any duplicates. 
Feel free to add fields not previously included if necessary.
*/

Question 4
=======================================================
Create a temp table including all the following fields for those who have purchased 
productname “widget2” excluding anyone who has purchased anything in the past 6 months. 
Assume the date fields are structured YYYYMMDD. Include the following fields:
    - customerid

            -- 1) You want orderdates from the last six months, starting right now
            -- 2) That I can't connect with whoever used the YYYYMMDD and convince
            --    them to use a standard date format

/*
Question 5
=======================================================
Count how many customers placed an order for a productname of “widget” 
with a quantity of 4 or more.

/*
Question 7
=======================================================
Add the column “active_customer_status” to table customers and place an 
indicator of 1 if the customer has placed an order within the past 6 months. 
Assume the date fields are structured YYYYMMDD. Place an indicator of 0 if 
the customer has not placed an order within the past 6 months.
