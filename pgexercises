/*
Rankmembers
Produce a list of members (including guests), along with the number of hours
they've booked in facilities, rounded to the nearest ten hours. Rank them by this
rounded figure, producing output of first name, surname, rounded hours, rank.
Sort by rank, surname, and first name.

Payback
Based on the 3 complete months of data so far, calculate the amount of time each
facility will take to repay its cost of ownership. Remember to take into account
ongoing monthly maintenance. Output facility name and payback time in months,
order by facility name. Don't worry about differences in month lengths, we're
only looking for a rough value here!
