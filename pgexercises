/* Rankmembers
Produce a list of members (including guests), along with the number of hours
they've booked in facilities, rounded to the nearest ten hours. Rank them by this
rounded figure, producing output of first name, surname, rounded hours, rank.
Sort by rank, surname, and first name. */

-- My answer:
select
    mbs.firstname,
		mbs.surname,
		round(sum(bks.slots*.5),-1) as hours, -- Their answer didn't like this, but the round(*whatever*,-1) will take it to the closest 10s, they used math instead
		rank() over (order by sum(bks.slots) desc) as rank
	from cd.bookings as bks
	inner join cd.members as mbs
		on bks.memid = mbs.memid
	group by mbs.memid
	order by rank, mbs.surname, mbs.firstname
;

-- Their answer:
select
    firstname,
    surname,
    ((sum(bks.slots)+10)/20)*10) as hours,
    rank() over (order by ((sum(bks.slots)+10)/20)*10 desc) as rank
    from cd.bookings bks
    inner join cd.members mems
        on bks.memid = mems.memid
    group by mems.memid
order by rank, surname, firstname
;

/* Facrev3
Produce a list of the top three revenue generating facilities (including ties).
Output facility name and rank, sorted by rank and facility name. */

-- My answer:
select
    name,
    rank from (
        select
            fcs.name as name,
            rank() over (order by sum(case
                                      when bks.memid = 0 then bks.slots*fcs.guestcost
                                      else bks.slots*fcs.membercost
                                      end) as rank
          from cd.bookings bks
          inner join cd.facilities fcs
              on bks.facid = fcs.facid
          group by fcs.name) as subq
